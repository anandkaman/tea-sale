# Google Services Configuration 🔐

The real `google-services.json` file has been excluded from this repository for security reasons.

## How to set up:
1. Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Download your project's `google-services.json`.
3. Copy it into the `app/` directory of this project.

The app will not build or run without this file as it contains the API keys and identifiers for Firestore and Authentication.
